A do and don't I want to adhere to next one month and why I think they are awesome.

## Show up at your job everyday

Figuratively we show up at our workplaces everyday, but very few times we show up to do our best work come whatever it may be. We are just ambling through motions trying to get tasks done. I want to be more mindful at workplace and get out of it as close to 5pm possible. Meaning once it is 5PM for 90% of days I want to close my laptop and not work on work related stuff. I want to add a buffer of max 30 minutes on any given day for work related stuff. Its that simple, I am hoping this would force me to be lot more productive at work. And being at home helps in being productive.

## Avoid one upman ship

This entails lot of things. At the top level, this comes directly out of being humble principle at amazon. There were so many instances in my career where I lost learning important lessons because of the urge to show I know more than other person or team in question. It is very difficult to avoid this characteristic, my mind is always working towards show of strength. When somebody comments on a pr, the first response I get is "yes, I have thought about it" instead of saying "thanks for pointing that out to me". To keep it simple I want to avoid starting any sentences of the form "yeah, I know it" and become the best listener I can be.
