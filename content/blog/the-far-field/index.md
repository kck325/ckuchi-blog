Picked up this [book](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07MBGQK78/) from a twitter cause it was setup in Kashmir (non valley). Got intrigued by premise and the reviews it got. I was itching to read some fiction setup in Indian backdrop and this seemed perfect. It's a page turner once you get through first few episodes.

Good:

- Engaging narration
- Strong characters
- Good conflict points
- To some extent ending
- Explaining intents and incentives of each character that were encountered
- Did not feel like fiction much
- Way everyone signals about how they like India, but really dont do anything for it

Bad:

- Any non-obvious characters almost always have sexual tensions
- I know the lead character is young, but questionable choices all through out
- Some unnecessary characters, saw no point
- Contrived ending
- Left some threads hanging

Overall rating:

I definitely enjoyed the book, but was very disappointed about ending and the loose threads left all over the place. Story is very believable and narrated in a very lucid way. After a long time completed a book within 48 hours. For me the biggest put down is sexual friction between lead character and any new male character she encounters in life. Wish they down played it a little. Really enjoyed all the episodes setup in valley. Loved the way how author showcased how our actions might have long lasting impact on others.
