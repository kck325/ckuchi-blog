I am Chandra Kuchi. I work as an infrastructure @ [Robinhood](www.robinhood.com). I have worked through all parts of a software stack (including assembly language stuff ;)). I love all things backend, and more specifically data infrastructure. I enjoy building scalable systems which are simple to reason about and fast to iterate on. Hoping to document all the interesting things I encounter on a semi regular basis. Theme of the blog mainly is going to be silly things I spent more time than I like to admit debugging on.
